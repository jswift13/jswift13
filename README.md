# 👋 Hi there! I'm Jen!

I transitioned from marketing to IT, and I bring both storytelling and structure to how I work. Presently I’m studying Systems Analysis and Development, building hands-on projects to learn how code meets data to solve problems.

## What I'm currently working on

- An app to help amateur and small professional sports teams be more efficient and reach better sponsors.
- Hobby projects to test what I learn

## Things I've been learning

- Python scripting + automation (my favorite!!)
- Java + JDBC + Oracle DB
- SQL
- Git & GitHub CLI
- UX/UI Design
- Concepts: object-oriented logic, encapsulation, REST

Before tech, I worked on creative campaigns, production, and market research projects. That gave me:

- Strategic thinking: I like to understand the “why” behind what I’m building
- Communication: I explain decisions clearly and collaborate well
- Curiosity: I don’t mind being a beginner, as long as I keep moving

## What I'm looking for

I’m currently seeking my **junior role** in development, in an environment where I can grow fast and contribute early.

## Let's connect

Feel free to open an issue or drop me a message if you want to chat about projects, feedback, or more. Thanks for stopping by!
