# 👋 Hi there! I'm Jen!

I transitioned from branding to backend, and I bring both storytelling and structure to how I code. Today I’m studying Systems Analysis and Development, building hands-on projects in Java and Python, and learning how code meets data to solve real-world problems.

## 💻 What I'm working on

- 🧾 A personal finance tracker in Java with relational database modeling and backend logic
- 🧠 Hobby projects to test what I learn — like a Python terminal game for pattern recognition
- 📊 Building my first data pipeline: from scraping women’s football data to basic visualization

## 🧪 Things I've been learning

- Python scripting + automation (my favorite!!)
- Java 17 + JDBC + Oracle DB
- SQL (CREATE, INSERT, JOIN, etc.)
- Git & GitHub CLI
- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap (for simple UI flows)
- Concepts: object-oriented logic, encapsulation, REST

## 🧠 Background that shapes how I code

Before tech, I worked on creative campaigns, audiovisual production, and research projects. That gave me:

- Strategic thinking: I like to understand the “why” behind what I’m building
- Communication: I explain decisions clearly and collaborate well
- Curiosity: I don’t mind being a beginner, as long as I keep moving

## 🔍 What I'm looking for

I’m currently seeking my **first internship** in data science in an environment where I can grow fast, contribute early, and keep building smarter tools.

## 📫 Let's connect

Feel free to open an issue or drop me a message if you want to chat about projects, feedback, or internships. Thanks for stopping by!
